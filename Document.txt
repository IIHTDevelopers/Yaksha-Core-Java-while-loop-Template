Project Overview:
This project focuses on evaluating the participants' ability to implement decision-making and repetition logic using the while loop in Java. The while loop allows for efficient iteration and repetition of a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. This document presents the tasks, Java code for implementation, and a test case class to evaluate the use of the while loop statement.

Learning Objectives:
By the end of this project, participants will be able to:

Use the while loop to perform repetitive tasks until a specific condition is met.
Understand the importance of loop termination conditions to prevent infinite loops.
Implement practical problems using the while loop structure.
Assessment Tasks:
Task 1: Print Numbers from 1 to N
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to a given number N using a while loop. Example:

Input: N = 5
Output: "1 2 3 4 5"

Task 2: Sum of First N Natural Numbers
Write a program that calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers using a while loop. Example:

Input: N = 4
Output: "Sum: 10"

Task 3: Factorial of a Number
Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number N using a while loop. Example:

Input: N = 5
Output: "Factorial: 120"

Task 4: Count Down from N to 1
Write a program that counts down from a given number N to 1 using a while loop. Example:

Input: N = 5
Output: "5 4 3 2 1"

Task 5: Print Fibonacci Sequence Up to N Terms
Write a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the Nth term using a while loop. Example:

Input: N = 7
Output: "0 1 1 2 3 5 8"
